The page features a clean white background (#FFFFFF) with dominant text in a dark gray (#333333). At the top, the navigation bar is horizontally aligned, with the brand/logo positioned on the left and menu items (Home, Menu, Pre-order, Reservation, Contact Us) aligned to the right, with "Reservation" emphasized as active, indicated by a subtle underline in a vibrant green (#4CAF50), while other items remain in a standard dark gray. The spacing between the nav items is medium, approximately 20px, with a pill treatment for the active item. Below the nav bar, the content is organized into a single row containing four equal-width cards (1/4 each) for Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages, each with a title in bold, a brief body text description, and a rounded button labeled "Explore Menu" in a solid green (#4CAF50) with white text, while the card backgrounds are light gray (#F9F9F9) with a subtle shadow effect and a border radius of 10px, spaced with a medium gap of 30px between them. The footer is centered, featuring a smaller text size than the body, in a matching dark gray (#333333) against a white background, with the copyright notice in a smaller font size. The typography employs a system sans-serif font family, with a base size of approximately 16px for body text and a hierarchy that includes larger sizes for headings, ensuring clarity and readability throughout the layout.
