The page features a light background color (#F9F9F9) with dominant text in a dark shade (#333333). The NAV BAR is positioned at the top row, with the brand/logo aligned to the left and navigation items ("Home," "Shop," "Blog," "Contact") aligned to the right in a horizontal layout, with "Shop" emphasized as the active item, indicated by a subtle underline in a darker shade (#000000) compared to the default color (#666666). The CONTENT is organized into three rows: the first row contains a single large card titled "Welcome to our Store," featuring body text and a prominent rounded button labeled "Shop Now" with a filled background color (#FF5733) and white text; the second row consists of four equal-width cards (1/4 each) titled "Featured Product," "New Arrivals," "Special Offers," and "Contact Us," each with body text and rounded buttons labeled "Explore More," "Check it out," "Save More," and "Contact Now," respectively, all having a white background with a light gray border (#DDDDDD) and colored CTAs (#FF5733); the third row contains three equal-width cards (1/3 each) titled "About us," "Customer Reviews," and a final button labeled "Learn more" and "Read Reviews," with similar styling as the previous row. The spacing between cards is medium with approximately 20px gutters, and the cards have a border-radius of about 8px. The FOOTER is centered with smaller text size relative to the body, featuring a background color (#333333) and white text (#FFFFFF). The typography uses a system sans-serif font family, with a base size of approximately 16px and a heading hierarchy that increases in size for titles and buttons.
